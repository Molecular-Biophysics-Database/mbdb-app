                        Micro Scale Thermophoresis is used to measure binding affinities in solution in capillaries, using only a small amount of sample. The applications range from small-molecule binding events to protein-protein interactions and interactions within complex macromolecular assemblies. MST can be performed both with extrinsic fluorescent labels (Monolith NT.115, NanoTemper) or intrinsic fluorescence (Monolith NT.LabelFree instrument, NanoTemper).

                        <li>
                            Purity is critical for covalent amine labelling since all primary amines will be labelled including those present in any contaminants. Whenever possible, non-covalent labelling of His tags is preferred.

                            Approx. 200 µL of the labelled target (at a concentration allowing a sufficient fluorescence signal to be measured) is needed per titration.

                            20-50 µL of the unlabelled ligand molecule is required per titration, at a concentration 20-100 fold above the expected Kd.

                        Biolayer interferometry is a method for measuring the affinity and kinetics of macromolecular interactions, involving proteins, nucleic acids, oligosaccharides, lipids… but also in some cases small ligands. One of the interaction partners has to be attached, either covalently or non-covalently, to the surface of a glass sensor, which is then dipped into a microplate well containing the other interaction partner. The association and dissociation between the interaction partners are monitored in real time at the surface, by following the variations of the optical depth of the surface layer by interferometry.

                            Crude samples (such as culture supernatants or cell lysates) can be readily used to detect interaction and for comparison
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sample concentrations are typically 1 and 50 µg/ml and volumes of 100-200 µl per sensor for the immobilized component.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For interaction measurement, 100-200 µl of the interaction partners in solution are required at concentrations ranging from 1/10 to 10x the Kd. If the Kd range is unknown, optimization experiments need to be performed first to estimate the useful concentration range, before embarking into more precise studies to determine accurately the Kd and the association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rates.

                            The attachment of one of the macromolecules to a functionalized surface is required. A variety of immobilization procedures can be considered: covalent (via amide bonds) or non-covalent (via His6, GST or Fc tags, biotin moieties, …). BLI instruments are non-microfluidic systems which do not clog and are therefore well suited for the study interactions in crude samples such are cell lysates or culture supernatants.

                        Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is used for the real-time monitoring and quantification of the interaction between target biomolecules and putative binding partners. The target (referred to as the ligand) is immobilized on a functionalized surface, the so-called sensor chip. SPR measures the effect on reflected light from the plasmon resonance wave propagating along the sensor chip. Intensity changes, or deviations in the reflection angle, induced by subtle changes in the refractive index of the sensor chip surface is monitored. This property is extremely sensitive to changes to the surface density, such as that caused by the binding of an analyte to the immobilized ligand. Both the association (ka or kon) and dissociation (kd or koff) rates can be measured yielding the equilibrium dissociation constant KD. Typical measurable KDs range from (less than) nM to mM.

                        Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a technique that can quantitatively measure the interaction between molecules, often proteins, in terms of binding affinity (KD), change in enthalpy (ΔH) and reaction stoichiometry (n). This is done by measuring the heat either released or absorbed when titrating a ligand into the sample solution. Titration is made stepwise in small aliquots of the ligand, and the corresponding heat is measured for each step. The instruments are very sensitive; heats below 1 microcalorie can be detected. The direct output is the thermal power applied by a feedback system in order to keep the temperatures of both cells (sample and reference) as close as possible, despite any perturbation (e.g., complex formation) taking place upon each ligand addition, giving rise to the thermogram. For each step in the titration sequence the molar ratio (ratio of reactant concentrations within the sample cell) of the ligand and sample changes until the sample approaches saturation. The resulting curve of the heat (typically kcal/mol ligand) vs the ligand:sample molar ratio is called the binding isotherm. The affinity (KD), enthalpy change (ΔH), and the stoichiometry (n) are estimated by non-linear regression using an appropriate binding model
